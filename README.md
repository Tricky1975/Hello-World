Just a bunch of "Hello World" codes in several programming languages

# Disclaimer

I did write most of the files I submitted myself, by myself, but I will admit that some of these have been copied from other sources (most notably wikipedia).
That goes for:
- Brainfuck
- COBOL (both examples)
- COW
- D
- Haskell
- INTERCAL
- Java
- Shakespear
